    <p>The Pomeranian (also known as a Pom, Pommy or Pome) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region<br> in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the<br> Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz.</p>

        Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises.[6]</p>
